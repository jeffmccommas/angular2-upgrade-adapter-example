# ngUpgrade Example

Simple example of Angular 1.5 with ui-router, running in parallel with Angular 2 by way of the upgrade adapter. The project has the following module types updated:

* Directives -> Components
* Filters -> Pipes
* Services -> Providers

The app still runs using ui-router (sorry, no ng2 router usage). Also I apologize for the terrible movie poster quality, Rotten Tomatoes no longer serves hi-res images from its API.

## Running the Application

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server
